The app is designed for people who are building their own Move-In-Ready house in Finland. People can share their experiences of everything related to construction, for example recommendations, pictures, what didn't go as planned and some nice-to-know facts for those who are still planning their project.

User can post pictures/posts and keep a construction-diary in the app. Users can find easily other people that are building or have built their houses with the same house package ('talopaketti') or with the same company. 

Also companies and entrepreneurs can create their own account and advertise their services. They can also create posts and share pictures of their references. They can also mark their work-area on the map, so people that are building near by can easily find and use their services.
